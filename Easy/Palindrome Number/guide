Basic Guidelines:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Observations:
- Negatives will always not be palidromes
- Plaidromes focus on checking that things over the center are equal, so we can do that
- We only need to check that half of the numbers are equal to the otehr half once
